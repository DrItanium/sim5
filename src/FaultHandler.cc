/* Taken from the Kx manual:
 *
 * Algorithm for implicit, local call/return
 * When the selected fault-handler entry in the fault table is an entry type
 * 0b00 (local procedure), the processor performs the following action:
 *
 * 1. The processor stores a fault record on the top of the stack that the
 * process is currently using. The stack can be the local stack, the supervisor
 * stack, or the interrupt stack
 *
 * 2. If the fault caused an instruction to be suspended, the processor
 * includes an instruction-resumption record on the current stack and sets the
 * resume flag in the saved process controls.
 *
 * 3. The processor creates a new frame on the current stack, with the
 * frame-return status field set to 0b001
 *
 * 4. Using the procedure address from the selected fault-table entry, the
 * processor performs an implicit call-extended (callx) operation to the fault
 * handler.
 *
 * If the fault handler is not able to perform a recovery action, it performs
 * one of the actions described in the section earlier in this chaper titled
 * "Possible Fault-Handler Actions."
 *
 * If the handler action results in a recovery from the fault, a ret
 * instruction in the fault handler allow processor control to return 
 * to the program that was being worked on when the fault occurred. On the
 * return, the processor performs the following action:
 *
 * 1. The processor deallocates the stack frame created for the fault handler
 *
 * 2. The processor copies the arithmetic controls field from the fault record
 * into the arithmetic controls register in the processor.
 *
 * 3. The processor then resumes work on the program it was working on when the
 * fault occurred at the instruction in the return IP register.
 *
 * My Commentary:
 *
 * The ret instruction handles the return-from-fault state already. I just need
 * to hook up the implicit callx instruction and describe the actions to be
 * performed in common terms provided to me. In all cases, when we raise a
 * fault it is a callx instruction with extra things to perform ahead of time.
